## How You Got In

Most people post videos on how they got into certain colleges. They cover their test scores, AP classes, extracurriculars, etc..., but if you want to know about only one aspect of their application (their SAT score for example), you would have to watch the entire video until they get to that point. With How You Got In, you can easily see this information without having to spend time watching and skimming through videos.
